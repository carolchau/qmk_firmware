# Carol's Lele60 Layout

## Layout Changes: 

### Layer Controls:
* 'Caps Lock' key is TO(2)
* Key to the right of Spacebar is TO(1)
* Key to the right of TO(1) is Grave

### Media Controls:
* TO(1) + W/D are for volume control
* TO(1) + A/D are for previous/next track 
* TO(1) + P is media play/pause track
* TO(1) + M is mute

### RGB Controls: 
* TO(1) + Z for changing Hue
* TO(1) + X for changing Saturation
* TO(1) + c for changing Value
* TO(1) + Z for changing RGB animation mode

### Others:
* TO(1) + Esc is 'RESET'
* TO(1) + 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0/-/= for F keys
* TO(1) + Backspace is Delete
* TO(2) + J/K/L/; for arrow keys

## Notes: 
* Hold the reset button on the back of the PCB while plugging in the board to get to the bootloader. 
* QMK does not officially have the Lele60 keyboard as of writing this, I based this off of andywith's changes I found here: https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/15105
* Not sure what the default animation on the Lele60 was as flashing it changed the default RGB animation.
